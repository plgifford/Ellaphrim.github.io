	<h3>Welcome! nerdyPenguin is a space dedicated to all my random projects and other beautiful stuff. It is also the homepage for the Feathered Encyclopedia, so Featherers can ignore this and keep clicking. If anyone out there has a story to tell or a picture to share or just some random derp stuff they want on the internets, email me at plgifford@gmail.com!</h3>
