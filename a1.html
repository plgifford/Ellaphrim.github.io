	<h1>Crow</h1>

	<p><center>
The crow was too big for the crack in the window of the old, dilapidated building, but it jammed its head into the hole, trying to force its body in and get away from the raging storm. As the crow finally squeezed through the jagged gash, it heard a whisper, saw a flash, and felt a sharp jab of pain as its neck was snapped by a long, black tentacle.

The sun was shining over the beautiful new complex the day the papers were signed. The buildingâ€™s location was perfect, looking out over a silver bridge spanning a wide, crystalline river. The new owner was delighted to cut the silk ribbon stretched across the front door and complete the purchase. His hair was jet black and, in the light of the afternoon, waved gently, making his head look like a nest of shimmering black snakes. Above, a crow circled in the afternoon breeze.

The black-haired man had owned the building for a yea, and successfully turned it into a beautiful office complex. No one quite knew what sort of work the man oversaw, but there was always a stream of people hurrying in and out of the building, and he could be seen on the top floor, his hair floating gently around him.

Six months after the building was opened Daniel Brown went missing. The black-haired man promised to do everything he could to help find his employee, and donated a large fund to the local police. He had grown a little plumper in the past weeks, and his hair seemed even more agitated than usual. A large colony of crows had taken up residence on the roof of the office, and they squacked and screamed at all hours of the night.

As the years went by, the building began to show signs of wear. The once clear glass panels had fogged up, and the figures behind them were now nothing but dark blurs.The crows on the roof were multiplying, and hundreds of inky black feathers surrounded the building.

It had been seven years since the building opened, and seven employees had gone missing. The streams of people going in and out slowed, and finally stopped. Although the rest of the building was dark, the black-haired man could still be seen at his desk on the top floor, although he occasionally flickered, like a shadow of the man he had once been. Thin no longer, the man had a huge girth, and his eyes had dark shadows under them.

Ten years.

Fifteen years.

Twenty years.
The silver bridge was covered in rust, and the crystal waters were dark with scum, but the building still stood, staring out over the devastation. The dark-haired man had not been seen in years, but the crows still lived on the roof of the building, streaking the sides of it with their refuse.

Thirty years.

Forty years.

There was a terrible storm one night, and when the sun rose, the crows were gone. Not a single feather remained on the steel shell that still loomed over the city. A few weeks later, a handsome black-haired man bought a beautiful skyscraper that had just been constructed on the edge of a nearby forest. 

He seemed quite jovial and agreeable, but when people came close, they noticed that his teeth were far longer that they should have been, with several rows of pointy canines, all gleaming pearly white, and just as they looked a little too close, a crow would scream nearby, and distracted, they would miss the fullness of the toothy smirk the man gave as he strode away, his hair swirling around his head.
