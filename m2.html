	<p><center>Front Line Soldier

A stick cracked. Max whirled around, his crudely made axe in front of him. “Don’t move! Put your hands up!” he yelled, hoping the intruder would not spot his shaking hands. There was a flash of red and Max lunged forward, throwing the stick and stone weapon out where the flash had been moments before. There was grunt and then a cry of pain. Without bothering to retrieve the broken mess of an axe Max stumbled back to the bloodstained pile of cloth where his fellow soldiers had left him two days ago thinking he was dead. “Don’t fall asleep.” Max ordered himself. But his eyes did not seem to want listen. Max slept for a bit then woke up in a sort of trance. He heard voices that he had last heard months ago. “War is a dangerous thing.” The voice of Max’s friend in the army, Michiel Galov, when they were having a talk that had been interrupted by an attack by the rebels.  “War can leave you hundreds of miles away from his family in a dense, uninhabited forest without any help or any weapon.” The general whom had signed him into the army. “That’s ironic.” A voice in Max’s head that must have been Max himself. “Look where saying yes brought me.” Then he must have fallen asleep again; he saw a vision of his house, clean with the summer sun glinting off the windows. He ran towards it, yelling “Martha! Martha!” His wife’s voice reached him, saying “Max? Is that you at last?” He ran towards the door and opened it, and suddenly he did a double take. Standing in front of him was a tall man in a red military uniform, holding a gun pointed straight at his face. All at once his nightmare came true. He was lying on the stained pile of fabric, while a rebel stood above him. The sounds of the forest came back. Max and the rebel studied each other for a moment, then the rebel called out; “Come on boys! We got him!”  Poor Max had no idea why everyone was looking for him. But Max’s first thought was “So close... I was so close.” That thought of his family made Max leap into action. There was battle cry that seemed to come right from where Max was lying. “Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!” Before he knew what he was doing, Max had whirled around and grabbed a tree branch that looked to be sharp enough to poke his eye out. Ignoring all training from the past months, he swung the branch back and forth, taking red-uniformed people out left and right. But no matter how many rebels Max took out, more of them jumped out from the trees. “Max Scallor…” one of the men whispered before lying still on the forest floor. But Max soon realized that ignoring training was a bad idea. He had turned around and seen the cliff edge that was only a few yards behind him. The rebels were forcing him to back into a cliff, and he had not noticed it until now. “Too late to turn back” Max said to himself, a grim expression on his face. Suddenly the flow of soldiers stopped. Max felt a burst of adrenalin rush through him, and he fought harder than he had ever before. Within minutes all of the rebels lay on the stony ground. But Max did not feel like celebrating. Instead, he sat down on a rock and thought. “They aren’t coming back for me.” Max said bitterly. “So why should I stay here? There’s no point in it.” He went slowly to the edge of the cliff and looked down. The ground suddenly felt further away than ever. “Here goes nothing.” Max took a step forward and was immediately reminded of when he would walk off the diving board at his house with his children years ago. Max held on to that thought as he took the last step and slowly started to fall off the edge of the cliff. Max was happy, and he blocked out everything but the happy thought of his children. He did not feel when he hit the ground on the mattress in the middle of a search party. He did not hear the excited voices. He did not hear the voices saying that he was alive. He did not feel the hands cleaning him and placing him in the truck bound south. The truck that was heading home.
