	<h1>Ninth House</h1>
	<h2>Leigh Bardugo</h2>
	<h2>October 12, 2019</h2>
	<p>Ninth House, is a classic Bardugo novel, with a Gothic backdrop and a set of troubled, but dashingly attractive characters. As always, Bardugo provides the reader with an entertaining storyline, this time set on Yale's idillic campus. This is her first novel directed towards a more adult audience, and Ninth House explores the darker side of privileged college life with a grittier tone than the teen-friendly Grishaverse. As the reader watches Alex struggle with her both a Yale course load and the occult, it's easy to forget that her character is much more intricate than the black-and-white sketches of Alina and the Darkling. Alex's backstory is unlike anything Bardugo has written yet, and it adds a depth to the plot that readers previously hadn't seen in Bardugo's writing. The only place the book falls a bit flat is in the character of Darlington, who closely resembles almost all of the male leads in the Grishaverse. They all have the same impenetrable air, and are all stereotypical perfect young gentlemen with deadly secrets. 9/10 lost sleep in order to finish it :0</p>
