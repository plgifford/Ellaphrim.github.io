<h2>Non Magical Birds</h2>
	<p>Whether you are a seasoned ornithologist or a beginner birder, you can find reliable pages on your feathered subjects here. Enjoy! For more in depth information, I have linked many pages to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Untill I have enough time to really go in depth on these pages, Cornell can fill any information gaps. They have a great website, be sure to check it out!</p>
