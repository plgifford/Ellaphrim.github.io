<h1>About the Creator</h1>
<h3>Lake Gifford</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Lake, the creator of the Feathered Encyclopedia. I love birds, both magical and not, so I'm having the time of my life making this page. Lots of thanks to Girls Who Code for getting me started with a before school program, and my friends, who are trying to get me to include Mothra in this Encyclopedia. Natalia, Ferris, all I have to say is no. :)</p>
<p>I'm in the 7th grade at Trinity in New York, and I love to read, birdwatch, and do sciency stuff. When I grow up, I'm going to be either a biochemisist, a ornithologist, or a computer scientist. My favorite animals are penguins!</p>
