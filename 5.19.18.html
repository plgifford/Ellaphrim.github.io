	<h2><center>The Royal Wedding! (and some British reading...)</center></h2>
	<p><center>So, who actually got up at 5AM to watch the Royal Wedding? Me! Megan looked AMAZING in a very simple white dress with a open bateau neckline and sculpted waist. Her train was lacy and quite transparent, which looked nice walking in but was a mess during the ceremony. The service itself was nothing particular, with a very interesting speech from an episcopal minister (link at the end). I watched it with a Sephora Algae Face Mask and Lavender Foot mask on, which were quite excellent. My face is still glowing. If you want to get your hands on one of those, click below. </center></p>
