	<h2><center>The Royal Wedding! (and some British reading...)</center></h2>
	<p><center>So, who actually got up at 5AM to watch the Royal Wedding? Me! Megan looked AMAZING in a very simple white dress with a open bateau neckline and sculpted waist. Her train was lacy and quite transparent, which looked nice walking in but was a mess during the ceremony. The service itself was nothing particular, with a very interesting speech from Bishop Michael Curry. I watched it with a Sephora Algae Face Mask and Lavender Foot mask on, which were quite excellent. My face is still glowing. If you want to get your hands on one of those, click below. </center></p>

	<p><center>I also came up with a book to match the event, like always. Love and Luck is an Irish talke of heartbreak and love by Jenna Evans Welch. Amazon says: "Addie is visiting Ireland for her aunt’s over-the-top destination wedding, and hoping she can stop thinking about the one horrible thing she did that left her miserable and heartbroken—and threatens her future. But her brother, Ian, isn’t about to let her forget, and his constant needling leads to arguments and even a fistfight between the two once inseparable siblings. Miserable, Addie can’t wait to visit her friend in Italy and leave her brother—and her problems—behind. So when Addie discovers an unusual guidebook, Ireland for the Heartbroken, hidden in the dusty shelves of the hotel library, she’s able to finally escape her anxious mind and Ian’s criticism. That is if they don’t get completely lost along the way." It's a great book for those who found themselves reaching for the tissues during the wedding, and it's hilarious!

	<p><center>Last, expect a post sometime this weekend on some makeup I recived from Seventeen Magazine. It looks pretty snazzy, but we'll see. Also expect a new blog section to go up: Book Reviews. I hope you'll like it!</center></p>

	<h3><center>Lots of love, Amwhiskers</center></h3>
