	<center><p>I flick a speck of dust off my pristine white MechoMan bodysuit and sigh, looking at the plate of dried potato in front of me. Potato is a luxury, a remnant of the Old Ways, and I’m lucky to be able to eat it. But I’ve never liked the flavor. It’s too bland.
Finally, I give up and toss the plate in the Food Receptacle, hearing a soft hiss as it burns. Pulling my long dark hair back into a ponytail, I send a T.M (thought message) to my adult. 
Hey Cynthia. I finished supper. I’m heading out. Looking for Peter.
Within seconds, I hear her Voice Message in my ear. Since she’s over 23, she can use her voice, and rubs it in my face all the time. 
“Ok Katie. While you’re out, stop and get me some TunSal. We don’t have any.” I sigh. The dried tuna salad Cynthia loves is utterly disgusting. 
I roll my eyes towards the long winding staircase that leads upstairs, knowing her secret camera is right there. Sometimes Cynthia gets on my nerves. 
Slamming the double doors behind me, I turn my attention to finding Peter. He’s a boy my age, 13, and the closest thing I ever had to a Sibling, something I read about in a book about the Old Ways. Believe it or not, they had real Families back then, with people who had the same Parents. Thank goodness it’s all changed. 
I swing my leg over my hoverbike, feeling the MechoMan suit activate to make it easier. As I twitch the handle, my bike speeds down the street, and I gaze at the humongous screen on the face of the Town Tower, which stands at 3,501 feet tall. The Man, our leader, gazes imperiously down at us. 
“Remember, if your are under 23, refrain from using your voice.” His booming voice reminds us all. I roll my eyes. Like I would know how to. I’ve never spoken in my life. “And check that the batteries in your voice controller are still on. If you are caught with it dead…” His voice trails off, like it always does. I stare at the white marble streets as my bike zooms on, already synced with my thoughts. Find Peter. I remind it. It hums gently, as if responding.
Suddenly, it slows at an ally in between the endless expanses of white buildings. Startled, I look down the shadowed pathway. Squinting, I can barely make out two figures, one clearly shorter than the other. Gently nudging my bike towards them, a sudden realization comes to me. Is that...The Man? With Peter? I've seen both of their silhouettes so often I immediately decide I’m correct. I’m stepping off my bike when suddenly The Man sees me, jumps, grabs Peter, and with a flash and a soft hiss, both disappear. 
What?! Peter? I T.M him, but there is no reply. Shocked, I open my mouth without remembering to stop myself. 
“P-Pe-Peter?”
And I hear my voice for the first time, soft and unsure, but ready to change the world.</p></center>
