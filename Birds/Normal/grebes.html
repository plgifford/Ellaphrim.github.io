<h1>Podicipediformes (Grebes)</h1>
<p>Grebes, bless their little quacking hearts, are diving birds that dwell in freshwater areas. Grebes are smaller birds, excellent swimmers, and have webbed (lobed) toes. Although they are adept at diving, grebs are somewhat failures when it comes to running. Their wings are also narrow, causing some breeds to be less than fond of flight. The order only contains a single family, called the Podicipedidae. Podicipedidae contains 22 species.</p>
