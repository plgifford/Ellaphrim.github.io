	<h3>I know almost nothing about Pokem贸n, so the credits for the winged Pokem贸n here will go to Brad, Carlton, Natalia, Ferris, and other Pokem贸n fans.</h3>
	<p>This page documents all Pokem贸n that are described as having "At least one set of wings". Although whether some of them have feathers is questionable, they still get a place in the encyclopedia.
