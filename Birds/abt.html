<h1>About the Creator</h1>
<h3>Lake Gifford</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Lake, the creator of the Feathered Encyclopedia. I love birds, both magical and not, so I'm having the time of my life making this page. I'm 13, and a 7th grader at Trinity School in New York City. I love swimming, dancing, and reading, I'm a huge Eragon fan, and penguins are my absoulute favorite animals!! Lots of thanks to Girls Who Code for getting me started with a before school program, and my friends, who are trying to get me to include Mothra in this Encyclopedia. Natalia, Farris, all I have to say is no. :)</p>
<p>I also love to birdwatch and do sciency stuff. When I grow up, I'm going to be either a biochemisist, a ornithologist, or a computer scientist.</p>
